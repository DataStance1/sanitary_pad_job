# sanitary_pad_job
This is a documentation of how I prepared a messy dataset for analysis for a client's project.
In this data pre-processing, here are some data quality issues I handled
* numerous unique values in a column
* misspelt words
* multiple responses for a cell (comma-separated values)
  
  I also documented every challenge I face working on this dataset and how I dealt with it.
* importing files into pgAdmin
* importing and recoding data in SPSS
